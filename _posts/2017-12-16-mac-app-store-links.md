title: Mac App Store Links
---

Below is a list of Mac App Store links (`macappstore://`) I've compiled. If there's any I missed, please [let me know](/contact/)!

During my testing, I found Mac App Store links work as expected in Safari and Firefox, but not Chrome. This could be due to my local config, your mileage may very.

- Direct App Link: `macappstore://itunes.apple.com/app/id425424353`
- Featured Tab: `macappstore://`
- Top Charts Tab: ?
- Categories Tab: ?
- Updates Tab: `macappstore://showUpdatesPage`
- Purchased Tab: `macappstore://showPurchasesPage`
- Search: `macappstore://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search?q=SEARCHTERM`
- Search (UTI): `macappstore://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/docTypeLookup?uti=YOURUTI`
- Search for apps that support a specific file extension: `macappstore://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/docTypeLookup?extension=png`

**Note:** Mac App Store links can also be called from the command line (works without root privileges): `open macappstore://showUpdatesPage`
